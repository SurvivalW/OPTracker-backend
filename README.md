**THIS IS JUST THE BACKEND**

A rudimentary backend created to support a personal learning exercise in web development. This service pairs with the [OPTracker frontend](https://survivalw.github.io/OPTracker-frontend/) to provide basic data scraping functionality for Amazon product pages.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a practice project. It is neither stable nor production-ready. Its sole purpose is educational experimentation.

## ⚙️ What It Does

This backend powers the frontend by accepting product URLs and scraping simple data from Amazon pages:

- **Product Title**
- **Price**
- **Availability** (e.g., in stock, out of stock)
